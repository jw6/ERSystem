Part 1.
Create a new project

Create an interface
-At least one method, and variable

-----POJOS------------------------
Create an abstract class
-with 2 properties
-with 3 methods, at least 1 concrete, 1 abstract

Extend 2 classes from that abstract class
-Implement the interface
-Provide 2 additional Methods 
-Provide a constructor that will Syso
-Add 2 throws exception declaration to 2 methods, 1 checked, 1 unchecked

Extend 2 SubClasses
-Provide a Constructor that Calls Super Constructor and Syso afterwards
-Check the inherited methods and the exceptions
-----------------------------------

Make a main class that shows you used all the above
Test the senarios below (not graded)
1. Instantiate an class with an AbstractClass Reference, 
	use control space to see what variables, and methods are available
2. Cast that AbstractClass reference down. Which method is called the parent or child?
3. Can you remove the exceptions in the subClasses? 
	or change it from RuntimeException to Exception or vice versa
	Can you change it to a different Exception?
4. Catch the Exceptions, add a finally block, call a method from the catch block
	Does the method run before or after the finally block?
5. What are the default values of each scope?
	Objects = null for instances at Static aka Class scope
	Objects = ? for Instance, Parameter, and Local scope?
	Each primitive dafault value?

Part 2:
Persist one instance to a file through 
	1.Serialization and read from it
	2.FileReader/Writer
	3.BufferedReader/Writer

Bonus: Read from Console to allow input from the user of the application to interact
	with the your POJOs
